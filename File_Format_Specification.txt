Technical details on Compact Points-to-pixels file format
for satellite-based atmospherical inversion algorithms
Testing and validation.

CPT version: 0.1

File format hierarchy:
  -Header:
    -Magic number:
       13 bytes of carefully chosen characters, which are
       {0x02, 'L', 'e', 'r', 'S', 'A', 'T', '@', 'c', 'p',
       't', '\n', 0x03}
    -Version:
       1 byte consists of 4 bits major version and 4 bits
       minor version. e.g. 10000110 corresponds version 8.6
    -Count of Ptx(ns):
       4 bytes unsigned integer indicating number of Ptx,
       which is the fundamental component of Data(L22).
    -Count of parameters per Point(np):
       1 byte unsigned integer indicating number of params
       inside Point(L33).
  -Data: *Consists of [ns] Ptx.
    -Ptx:
      -Pt: *Point may be multiple according to nt(L30).
        -Geolocation:
           4 bytes single floating point number of
           longitude and 4 bytes single floating point
           number of latitude and 2 bytes signed integer
           of altitude.
        -Count of Point(nt):
           1 byte unsigned integer indicating number of
           Point, described below.
        -Point: *Param may be multiple according to np.
          -Datetime:
             8 bytes unsigned integer indicating seconds
             elapsed since the Epoch(1/Jan/1970T00:00)
          -Param:
             8 bytes double floating point number.
      -Px: *Vicinity may be multiple according to nv(L76).
        -Datetime:
           Same as that in Point(L34).
        -Pixel: *Channel may be multiple due to nc(L50).
                *Extra may be multiple due to ne(L71).
          -Geolocation:
             format like Geolocation in Pt, as well as an
             extra 1 byte unsigned integer indicating
             sea-land mask.
          -Dimensions:
             2 bytes consists of 1 byte unsigned integer
             indicating count of valid Channels(nc) and 1
             byte unsigned integer indicating count of
             valid layers(nl).
          -Channel:
            -Centre wavelength:
               2 bytes signed integer indicating the centre
               wavelength of this channel. If the number is
               negative, this channel is polarized.
            -Observing values:
               multiple(nl) 8 bytes double floating point
               number indicating observing-related values,
               e.g. DN, reflectance at TOA, or intensity,
               etc. If centre wavelength is negative, there
               are extra multiple(nl) 8 bytes Q and
               multiple(nl) 8 bytes U.
            -Scanning angles:
               multiple(nl) 8 bytes single floating point
               number indicating solar zenithal angles,
               followed by viewing zenithal angles, solar
               azimuthal angles, and viewing azimuthal
               angles with similar format.
          -Count of Extra info(ne):
             1 byte unsigned integer indicating number of
             Extra info of parent Pixel.
          -Extra:
             8 bytes floating point number.
        -Count of valid nearby Pixels(nv):
           1 byte unsigned integer indicating number of
           valid Pixels around the centre Pixel.
        -Vicinity:
           Same as Pixel(L42).
  -Ending: 16 bytes of zeros indicating EOF

Magick usage prompt from dev:
nl(L52) may be set to 0 in order to store retrieval data
exclusively, into Extra data space(L74).
